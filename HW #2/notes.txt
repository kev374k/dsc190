Analysis Section:
1) Confidence Interval
2) EDA (comparison) - compare "Time" and "How Often" small writeup on our conclusions
3) Confidence Interval & Point Estimate (middle of the CI); hypothesis testing -> create histogram based on the shape of the sample distribution
4) Add some minor analysis (make histograms) and add our own analysis as well
    * Take the number of ppl in the second survey / total amount of people in the first
5) Graphical analysis 
    * Join the two tables? 
    * And then compare based on that
    * Both tables have the same amount of rows
    * Need to do data cleaning
6) Graphical distribution of the grades that students expect
    * Compare target distribution w/real distribution
    * 2Samp T-Test

Advanced Analysis:
    * come up with something in future
