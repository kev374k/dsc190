\subsection{Author Contributions}\label{author-contributions}

Brief description of the respective contribution of each team member.

Author 1: Worked on questions \#1, \#3, and \#5, and created the data
analysis template for the homework. Additionally, Author 1 worked on the
advanced analysis question, creating the visualization for the problem
and describing it.

\subsection{Use of GPT}\label{use-of-gpt}

ChatGPT was used as a substitute for documentation for R. Since we were
unfamiliar with R, we asked ChatGPT how to use R in certain methods in
order to find and filter out conditions in the dataset. We additionally
used GPT to analyze reasoning and to confirm what we thought was correct
about the dataset, as well as to identify extra questions that could be
answered for our advanced analysis.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The data provided is a Child Health and Development Studies dataset,
which consisted of all pregnancies that occurred from 1960-1967 among
women with the \textbf{Kaiser Health Plan} in Oakland, CA. Some
important things to note are that all 1236 babies in the dataset are
boys, there are no twins, and all lived at least 28 days. It's important
to keep in mind that this is not classified as a simple random sample of
all pregnancies, because the conditions just posed cannot be proven to
be a totally random sample of all babies born to mothers. However, we
are still studying this data beause it still should be a decent
representation of differences in weight between babies born to mothers
who smoked during pregnancy and those who didn't, even if it is not
totally representative of all babies.

\subsection{Main Research Questions}\label{main-research-questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the numerical distributions of the birth weight for babies
  born to women who smoked versus those who didn't smoke?
\item
  Is there a significant difference in these two distributions? If so,
  what type of conclusion can be reached?
\item
  What percentage of babies born between these two groups (non-smoking
  mothers and smoking mothers) are considered low-birth-weight babies?
  Is there a difference?
\item
  How does the reliability of the three types of comparisons -
  numerical, graphical, and incidence - change based on our data, and
  which was the best?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Outline}\label{outline}

The remainder of the report will go through a basic analysis of the
data, including our cleaning methods, basic analysis on various
variables in the study, and more. Additionally, we will analysis the
questions posed above, along with the conclusions that we came up with
in our data.

\section{Advanced Analysis}\label{advanced-analysis}

\subsection{Additional Research
Question}\label{additional-research-question}

How does smoking's impact on a baby's birth weight vary depending on how
long the pregnancy last?

\subsubsection{Methods}\label{methods-5}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{data_analysis_files/figure-latex/advanced-analysis-1.pdf}}

The method we used to analyze the relationship between one of the other
variables in the dataset, ``gestation'', and the babies' weights and
parents' smoking status was by using a scatterplot. For starters, we
wanted to visually see if there was a relationship between the gestation
period and the birth weight, so we used these as our x and y-axes,
respectively. In order to identify the difference smoking mothers and
non-smoking mothers, we realized that since it was a categorical
variable, we could color the dots to indicate it's status. Additionally,
we also created a regression line for each subset of mothers, so we
could see if a mother's smoking status could visually be represented
differently on the plot itself.

\subsubsection{Analysis}\label{analysis-5}

As a general trend, both smokers and non-smokers show a positive
correlation between gestation and birth-weight, indicating that the
longer a gestation period is, the baby's birth weight typically
increases.

We also see that the two regression lines (for smoking moms and
non-smoking moms) have different slopes. It's shown that the line
associated with the smoking moms has a steeper slope than than the line
associated with non-smoking mothers. This suggests that for smokers,
birth weight increases more rapidly with longer gestation periods for
smokers.

We can also notice that over the same gestation periods, babies born to
smokers tend to have lower birth weights than their respective
counterparts, as observed by the fact that the red line is consistently
lower than the blue line for most of the gestation period.

Another thing that can be noticed is the variability of the gestation
periods, specifically for non-smoking mothers. Looking through the data,
gestation periods for mothers ranged from 150-350 days, while smoking
mothers had a much smaller range, typically falling from a range of
220-330 days.

Finally, the last thing to notice from this graph is that there are
significantly less mothers that smoke than those that did not.

\subsubsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-5}

Through this graph, a few conclusions can be reached:

\begin{verbatim}
- Smoking is correlated with lower birth weight. The data shows a clear distinction between smokers and non-smokers in terms of their child's birth weight. Since the red line consistenly falls below that of the blue line for most gestation periods, it implies that on average, smoking is associated with lower birth weights.
- Gestation length is positively correlated with birth weight. This means that the longer a gestation period is, the higher the birth weight of a baby usually is.
- Non-smokers show a slower increase in birth weight compared to smokers. There can be many speculations about this, but looking at this graph, it seems that smokers typically have lower birth weights in the same gestation period as non-smokers, leading to their line needing to start at a lower area and climb back up to catch up to other babies that . This could also potentially mean that non-smokers typically have as much of a deviation of a child's birth weight as smokers do, since their slope is smaller, with many of their birth weights being concentrated, while children of smoking mother's have more variability in terms of their birth weight.
\end{verbatim}
